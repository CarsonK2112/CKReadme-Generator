My instructor and teaching assistants as well as extensive google searching contributed immensely to the completion of this project.<br> 
## Tests<br> 
This app can be tested by running through the prompts and checking to see if a readme is generated. If the user experiences any errors then VScode can be applied to generate console logs within the javascript in order to analyze the code therein.<br>
